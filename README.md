## What Have I Done:
I've made this bank management system using Python. I've used pickle, os and pathlib python module for made this program.

Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to file. Pickling is a way to convert a python object.

The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.

The Pathlib module in Python deals with path related tasks, such as constructing new paths from names of files and from other paths, checking for various properties of paths and creating files and folders at specific paths.


## Required Packages:
- pickle
- os
- pathlib


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the BankManagement.py file.
- You're done! Enjoy the bank management system.
